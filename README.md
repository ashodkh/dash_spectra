# dash_spectra
This is a Python module (dash_spectra.py) that contains a function to plot galaxies in 2D spaces (for example, mass and star formation rate) and shows the spectrum of each point that is hovered over in real-time. This is done using [Dash](https://dash.plotly.com/tutorial).

# Installation
dash_spectra.py is just a module that can be downloaded and placed in a directory. 

It has to be in a directory that can be recognized by python. This can either be the directory where you're running the code, or in a directory that python knows the path of.
