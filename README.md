# dash_spectra
This is a Python module (dash_spectra.py) that contains a function to plot galaxies in 2D spaces (for example, mass and star formation rate) and shows the spectrum of each point that is hovered over in real-time. This is done using [Dash](https://dash.plotly.com/tutorial).

Note this was built assuming the user is using Jupyter.

# Tutorial

The tutorial folder contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates how to use this module with SDSS data. The data was obtained using [astroML](https://www.astroml.org/).

# Installation
dash_spectra.py is just a module that can be downloaded and placed in a directory. 

It has to be in a directory that can be recognized by Python. This can either be the directory where you're running the code, or in a directory that [Python knows the path of](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4383571/importing-files-from-different-folder).
